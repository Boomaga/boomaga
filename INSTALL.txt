Installation
============

One simple solution is to install the program from the packets for your distribution kit. Access the list of packets at our site.

Prerequisites
=============

Should you wish to build the program from the sources, you would need header files for:
* ghostscript
* cups

The names of packets depend on your distributive. Here are instructions for some of the popular
distributives:

Ubuntu
------

    sudo apt-get libcups2-dev libgs-dev


Getting sources
===============

You can download sources of the latest stable version here. The home codes of the version
being developed are always accessible at our page in github (https://github.com/Boomaga/boomaga). You can get them as follows:

    git clone git://github.com/Boomaga/boomaga.git


Building and installing
=======================

We use so-called out-of-source builds. They support having different builds with different configurations simultaneously as well as easily remove the build directory if something goes wrong.
So, create a directory in ~/boomaga, say _build_, and cd into it. Type

    mkdir ~/boomaga/build
    cd ~/boomaga/build
    cmake ..

You may use alternative paths to some of the directories. Use the following options in cmake.

Option			Default for Linux			Description
-DCUPS_BACKEND_DIR	/usr/lib/cups/backend			Path to CUPS backends.
-DCUPS_PPD_DIR		/usr/share/ppd/boomaga			Path to CUPS PPD files.
-DDBUS_MACINE_ID_DIR	/var/lib/dbus				Path where D-Bus machine-id file is placed.
-DDBUS_SERVICE_DIR	/usr/<local>/share/dbus-1/services	Path to D-Bus service description files (http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-bus-starting-services).

Example:
    cmake -DCUPS_BACKEND_DIR=/usr/local/libexec/cups/backend -DDBUS_MACINE_ID_DIR=/var/db/dbus ..

For building and installing please perform the following commands:

    make && sudo make install


Installing the printer
======================

Once the program has been installed, it’s time to add the virtual printer. Please note that this has to be
done only once. You don’t have to install the printer over again when updating the program.

The best solution is to use the scripts/installPrinter.sh – just run it.

If you wish to install the printer on your own, select "Local Printers: Boomaga (Virtual boomaga printer)" in the "create printer" dialogue and indicate the type, "Generic Virtual boomaga printer" or, if you can’t access the previous, select "Generic PostScript printer".
