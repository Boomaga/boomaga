Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------

Should you wish to build the program from the sources, you would need header files for:

 * Qt4 or Qt5
 * cups
 * snappy
 * poppler
 * poppler-cpp


Building and installing
-----------------------

We use so-called out-of-source builds. They support having different builds with different configurations
simultaneously as well as easily remove the build directory if something goes wrong.
So, create a directory in ~/boomaga, say build, and cd into it. Type

mkdir ~/boomaga/build
cd ~/boomaga/build
cmake ..
